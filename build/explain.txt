The incident occurred in May of 2018. Words were exchanged that resulted in me being threatened with violence. I walked away but was followed to my vehicle by the other person in his vehicle. I approached his vehicle and he moved on. I touched the backend of the vehicle which I admitted to, but was accused of breaking the windshield which, I did not do. After spending more on the attorney than the fine the only choice was to accept the plea and pay the fine and move on with my life which, is what I did. If I had enough money I would have taken it trial.
