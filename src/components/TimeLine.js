                        for participant loans. 
                        Services were new loans, refinance loans, loan amortization schedule, if the participant is eligible for a loan are a few examples. 
                        Provided problem detection and resolution for a large distributed transactional system that is written in java 7. 
                        The system consists of a java swing application as well as batch processing during the night that is written with java code as well. 
                        Currently the swing UI is being replaced with a web application using JavaScript, CSS, Html as well as Angular. My responsibilities 
                        for that application were the same as the swing UI just with different technology. 
                        Data is stored in an Oracle 12 database. I used SQL to retrieve data as well as analyze and fix if needed </p>
